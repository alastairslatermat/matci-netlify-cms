![SAP InnovationX stage](/img/img_3506.jpg)

SAP hosted about 1,000 people to hear success stories and in-development innovations from their customers - including McLaren Applied Technologies through the [McLaren Deloitte partnership](http://www.deloitte.co.uk/mclaren/) - arranged over five stages:

* CustomerX
* Growth through disruption
* Your business. Better. Smarter.  Faster.
* HumanX
* Making a difference

From the eight talks I listened to across the five main stages, one topic kept emerging:

> "Humans make decisions too slowly for real-time data analysis"

Data can be fantastic.  It can give you insight into your customer, process, team, company, or whatever you want to measure.  Information is power! BUT, only if you understand it.  If it takes three months to decide how you might improve, why have the overhead of real-time data?

So, how do you provide actionable insight into your world through data?  Predictive models and analysis.  It should be no secret to IT given our sister companies - it's fundamental to what Racing do, and one of Applied Technologies' core competencies.  Why don't we do it more?  Why isn't it embedded our solutions?  What if this changes - what impact does it make?

The talks made me reflect on how I'm approaching a change request.  What caused the user to make the request - what is their actual problem?  I'm not going to pretend I know where to start with predictive modelling and analysis, but it sparked the thought and interest.  I need to track down the knowledgeable people in Racing and MAT, and read up on the topic - and revisit the current solution when I know more.

Maybe that Einstein chap had more to offer than just _that_ equation:

> "If I had an hour to solve a problem, I'd spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes about solutions"

If you're interested in any of the above (or have PhD and ten years experience in predictive modelling and analysis?) please drop me a line <mailto:alastair.slater@mclaren.com>
